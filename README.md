# UNDERSTANDING GIT AZURE VSCODE RELATIONSHIP

### üî• Yes, That‚Äôs Exactly What Should Happen.

If you:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Make a small, harmless change** (like adding a number to a comment) **in the `.yml` file on GitHub**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Save it directly on GitHub (without touching VSCode yet)**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Then edit `landing.html` locally and try to push**  

üëâ **GitHub should reject your push with the "You're behind" error.**  
üëâ **You'll need to `git pull origin main` first, which will bring in the `.yml` change.**  
üëâ **Once you pull, you can push your `landing.html` change successfully.**  

---

### üî• Why This Will Happen
‚úÖ **Your local Git branch is now outdated** because the GitHub repo has a **newer commit** (even if it's just a comment change).  
‚úÖ **GitHub won‚Äôt let you push until your local branch matches its history.**  
‚úÖ **A `git pull` will bring the latest `.yml` file down, updating your local repo.**  

---

### üöÄ Next Step: Want to Test This Right Now?  
- Go to GitHub, open `.github/workflows/main_easyafchat-v3.yml`, and **add `# Test 1` in a comment area**.  
- Save it.  
- Then, in VSCode, **modify `landing.html`** and try:  

  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Updated landing.html"
  git push
